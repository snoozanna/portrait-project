    <h1>The Portrait Project</h1>

    <section class="about">
      <p>This is the first volume of the Portrait Project, a piece in development by Coney, here represented by
        Parwinder Kaur as lead artist and interviewer, with support from Eliza Cass (producer), Suzanna Hurst
        (programmer), Tassos Stevens
        (ear).</p>

      <p>
        The purpose of the project is essentially to establish a relationship with locals that might result in a future
        collaboration, and to create a moment of reflection for the chosen people, giving them the opportunity to
        express
        their
        thoughts and opinions of the town, such as the likes and dislikes, as well as their connection to Tower Hamlets.
      </p>

      <p>
        The maker interviewed people from our local community (Tower Hamlets) with a series of questions broadly themed
        around
        local loveliness and secrets, and a record of the conversations was kept using a voice recording software and
        then
        transcribed for relevant quotes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The interviews happened online via Zencastr (following the government Covid-19 guidelines), which lasted the
        duration of
        a cup of tea. Parwinder then proceeded to sketch towards making a portrait of the interviewee (or a detail).
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea was to take the interview responses and the finished portraits and create a one page in a never-ending
        book,
        accessed by the audience when they go to a local cafe and buy a hot drink.
      </p>

      <p> The interviewees were asked a series of questions to make them feel at ease and to gather knowledge from them.

    <section class="questions">
      <p>The questions were the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What’s your favourite/ most lovely thing about this town?</li>
        <li>What’s your least favourite/lovely thing about this town?</li>
        <li>What’s your favourite cafe in town?</li>
        <li>What’s your favourite tea?</li>
        <li>What’s your favourite local business?</li>
        <li>When did you move to this town?</li>
        <li>What do you know about the place that others don’t know?</li>
        <li>What do you do that connects you to the place?</li>
        <li>
          Where does loveliness happen? E.g., people doing good things for each other,
          people doing charity work etc.
        </li>
        <li>Who is someone that brings you joy?</li>
        <li>What questions should I ask that I haven’t asked yet?</li>
        <li>What questions would you ask somebody else of Tower Hamlets?</li>
        <li>Who do you know that could have interesting roles in the community that could be useful to talk to?</li>
        <li>What do you not know that you really want to know?</li>
      </ul>
